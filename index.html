			<h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>
			<p class="intro-p"> &#8594 Poor sleep quality due to stress, discomfort, and other factors, impacts daily life and health. A study made in 2014 showed, the pillow temperature, pillow shape, and pillow content play a crucial role in the quality of sleep (Pubmed, 2014).</p>
            <p class="intro-p"> &#8594 Traditional pillows provide limited solutions, thus there was a need for a smart pillow that addresses individual comfort and improves sleep quality.</p>
            <p class="intro-p">  &#8594 The SmartRest pillow would be designed to improve sleep quality and enhance restful sleep being accessible to anyone. The smart pillow will incorporate different sensors and technologies to monitor sleep and adjust settings to customer’s preferences.</p>

			<h2 class="insights-title">Key Insights from Peer Evaluations</h2>
            <blockquote>"The product was actually very orignial which I truly enjoyed. I would have never thought about the product they made. The presentation was also very high quality and thought out."</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"I feel I could personally benefit from this product!"</blockquote>   
            <blockquote>"The mobile app looks great"</blockquote> 
            <p class="peer-p"> As per the feedback from the peer evaluations, our team did a great job demonstrating the features and capabilities of our prototype during our presentation. 
                Thanks for for clarity and percision during the presentation, most of the audience were able to understand the value and potential impact of our product.
            </p>
            <blockquote>"I really liked the product, however I believe the idea may have been too big."</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"Problem statement a little too large and not very practical to be able to implement, great prototype and presentation."</blockquote>
            <p class="peer-p">We also recived several constructive feedbacks from which our team can learn and improve from. Some of the feedbacks like the ones above suggest that while the prototype for a smart pillow with adjustable temperature, 
                thickness, and firmness was well-received, the idea may have been too ambitious and not practical to implement. One thing we could have improved on as a team is to strike a balance between ambition and practicality. 
                A more narrower and focused problem statement, better explanation of the benefits of the solution, and a fully functional hardware and software prototype to show the pillow adjustment in action could have improved our protoype.</p>
            <blockquote>"Once concern I have is the weight of the pillow, with all the technology inside of it, it could be too heavy for some users."</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"Loading up sensors, motors, and other electrical components would force the pillow to be rigid enough to protect the hardware."</blockquote>
            <p class="peer-p"> Another key insight we gathered was that the weight of the smart pillow prototype may be a concern for some users due to all the technology that is packed inside it. This may impact the comfort and usability 
                of the pillow, and could limit its appeal to a wider audience. We have also learned that the more sensors 
                that are packed inside the pillow, the more it is at risk of significant overheating due to its electrical components. Future iterations of our prototype could benefit from exploring ways to minimize the weight 
                and size of the hardware components, while also ensuring that the pillow remains comfortable and usable for customers.

			<h2>Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
			<p class="conclusion-p">In conclusion, SmartRest, the prototype for a smart pillow with adjustable temperature, thickness, and firmness offers an innovative alternative to the traditional pillows. While the feedback received 
                highlighted some potential areas for improvement, such as reducing the weight and size of the hardware components, and ensuring the pillow remains comfortable and usable, the product has great potential to provide a customizable and comfortable sleeping experience for users. 
            </br>
            </br>
                Future iterations of the prototype could benefit from further exploring ways to optimize the electircal hardware in the pillow and improving the app's user interface to provide an even more seamless and very intuitive 
                customization experience. With continued innovation and refinement, the smart pillow prototype has the potential to provide real value to users and revolutionize the sleeping experience.
